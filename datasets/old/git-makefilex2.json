Examples:\n#\n#   DEFAULT_EDITOR='~/bin/vi',\n#   DEFAULT_EDITOR='$GIT_FALLBACK_EDITOR',\n#   DEFAULT_EDITOR='\"C:\\Program Files\\Vim\\gvim.exe\" --nofork'\n#\n# Define COMPUTE_HEADER_DEPENDENCIES to \"yes\" if you want dependencies on\n# header files to be automatically computed, to avoid rebuilding objects when\n# an unrelated header file changes.

Note that you need recent glibc (at least 2.2.4) for this. On\n# Linux, kernel 2.6.11 or newer is required for reliable sub-second file times\n# on file systems with exactly 1 ns or 1 s resolution.

This option overrides NO_CROSS_DIRECTORY_HARDLINKS and\n# NO_INSTALL_HARDLINKS which will also use symlinking by indirection\n# within the same directory in some cases, INSTALL_SYMLINKS will\n# always symlink to the final target directly.\n#\n# Define NO_CROSS_DIRECTORY_HARDLINKS if you plan to distribute the installed\n# programs as a tar, where bin/ and libexec/ might be on different file systems.\n#\n# Define NO_INSTALL_HARDLINKS if you prefer to use either symbolic links or\n# copies to install built-in git commands e.g. git-cat-file.\n#\n# Define SKIP_DASHED_BUILT_INS if you do not need the dashed versions of the\n# built-ins to be linked/copied at all.\n#\n# Define USE_NED_ALLOCATOR if you want to replace the platforms default\n# memory allocators with the nedmalloc allocator written by Niall Douglas.\n#\n# Define OVERRIDE_STRDUP to override the libc version of strdup(3).\n# This is necessary when using a custom allocator in order to avoid\n# crashes due to allocation and free working on different 'heaps'.\n# It's defined automatically if USE_NED_ALLOCATOR is set.\n#\n# Define NO_REGEX if your C library lacks regex support with REG_STARTEND\n# feature.\n#\n# Define HAVE_DEV_TTY if your system can open /dev/tty to interact with the\n# user.\n#\n# Define JSMIN to point to JavaScript minifier that functions as\n# a filter to have gitweb.js minified.\n#\n# Define CSSMIN to point to a CSS minifier in order to generate a minified\n# version of gitweb.css\n#\n# Define DEFAULT_PAGER to a sensible pager command (defaults to \"less\") if\n# you want to use something different.  The value will be interpreted by the\n# shell at runtime when it is used.\n#\n# Define DEFAULT_EDITOR to a sensible editor command (defaults to \"vi\") if you\n# want to use something different.

Examples:\n#\n#   DEFAULT_EDITOR='~/bin/vi',\n#   DEFAULT_EDITOR='$GIT_FALLBACK_EDITOR',\n#   DEFAULT_EDITOR='\"C:\\Program Files\\Vim\\gvim.exe\" --nofork'\n#\n# Define COMPUTE_HEADER_DEPENDENCIES to \"yes\" if you want dependencies on\n# header files to be automatically computed, to avoid rebuilding objects when\n# an unrelated header file changes.  Define it to \"no\" to use the hard-coded\n# dependency rules.

Compiler version\n# and family are auto detected, but could be overridden by defining\n# COMPILER_FEATURES (see config.mak.dev). You can still set\n# CFLAGS=\"...\" in combination with DEVELOPER enables, whether that's\n# for tweaking something unrelated (e.g. optimization level), or for\n# selectively overriding something DEVELOPER or one of the DEVOPTS\n# (see just below) brings in.\n#\n# When DEVELOPER is set, DEVOPTS can be used to control compiler\n# options.
